# Provenance and history

## Authorship

Work by Nikhil Tamvada, with Claude (Anthropic) as a coding and analysis
assistant throughout. Commits carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude` where that applies.
Every result, decision rule and retraction recorded in `README.md` and
`detectors/PREREGISTRATION_OUTCOME.md` was reviewed by the author; the
pre-registration was committed before the code that produced the numbers it
governs (`63f5d95`).

## The git history interleaves two separate papers

This directory is one work-stream inside a shared repository. A second paper
lives in `chat2_papers/` and is not part of this work. For most of the history
the two are cleanly separated by directory, but **two commits touch both**:

    51a311d  2026-08-17  "clean up time"
    1b9beab  2026-08-05  "ig bro"

`1b9beab` is the substantial one: it adds this project's `run_all.py`,
`run_seeds.py` and their tests (then under `rebootpcl/`, renamed to `detectors/`
later) in the same commit as a rebuild of the other paper's `.docx`/`.pdf` and
its figures. `51a311d` is a wide rename/path cleanup across this project that
also changed one line of `chat2_papers/README.md`.

**Nothing is missing or damaged.** Every file is intact at `HEAD`, the test
suite passes, and `run_all.py` reproduces the results table. The history is
recorded here rather than rewritten: rewriting it would invalidate the commit
SHAs that `PREREGISTRATION_OUTCOME.md` and `README.md` cite as evidence of
ordering, and that ordering is part of this paper's argument.

The practical consequence for a reader: `git log -- chat1_protocol/` is the
correct way to see this project's history. A plain `git log` includes the other
paper's commits, and those two SHAs will appear in both views.

An earlier note recorded only `1b9beab`. The second, `51a311d`, was found by
enumerating every commit that touches both directories rather than trusting the
note — the same check the paper argues diagnostics should make on themselves.

## What is deliberately absent

**By decision, and settled:** per-stay caches derived from restricted clinical
data (`full_labels.npz`, `full_d5_arrays.npz`, `full_d2_pools.pkl`) are excluded,
and `.gitignore` enforces it. That is what the PhysioNet DUA calls for at
individual-stay granularity. Aggregate results are committed in
`detectors/results/*.json`; regenerate the caches with your own credentials via
`detectors/TODO.md` section 0. `run_all.py` does not need them. This is a policy
choice, not a missing file.

**By accident, and not recoverable:** detector 1's full-scale logs
(`full1_probe.out`, `full1_bootstrap.out`) came back empty when copied off the
machine that produced them. These are aggregate text, the same class of artifact
as the committed `detectors/logs/full2.out` and `full5.out`, so nothing prevented
publishing them — they were simply lost. Detector 1's full-scale figures are
therefore transcribed from run output rather than read from an archive.

The two are unrelated and should not be reported as one item. The first needs no
apology; the second is a genuine limitation on detector 1's provenance, and
`README.md` states it under "Provenance of detector 1's full-scale figures".
